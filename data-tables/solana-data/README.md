# ðŸ“Š Solana Data

## Introduction

[Solana](https://solana.com/) is a public, open-source blockchain that aims to deliver scalability and support smart contracts without sacrificing decentralization and security. It accomplishes this through a novel timestamp mechanism called [Proof-of-History](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274) (PoH). Using PoH, the network can order and batch transactions before theyâ€™re processed through a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism.

At full capacity, the Solana network will generate 1gb/s \* 365 days = 4 petabytes of data every year. This is huge and requires a solid backend infrastructure for performing day to day analytics.&#x20;

Also, the web3 analytics will move from SQL to higher order in near future and thus any analytics infrastructure on Solana should have the capability to accommodate these advanced use cases as well.

Here are the tables available on Top Ledger for raw Solana blockchain data.
