# Liquid Staking

#### How we are indexing our cnft\_trades table?&#x20;

We have written a Substreams to index this data. Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology developed by [StreamingFast](https://www.streamingfast.io/).

You can take a look at our indexing code [here](https://github.com/Topledger/solana-programs/tree/main/liquid-staking). The table below contains the project names and their respective program addresses that we have included in our liquid\_staking table.
