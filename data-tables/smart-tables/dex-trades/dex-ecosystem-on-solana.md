# ðŸ“Š DEX ecosystem on Solana

Letâ€™s calculate some important metrics for the DEX ecosystem and add them in a dashboard.

## Swap Transaction

We will start with calculating daily swap transactions on Solana. The chart below shows the daily swap transactions for entire DEX ecosystem.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 1.17.15 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Swap Transactions since Jan 2023</p></figcaption></figure>

Now, let's go through the SQL code used to create these metrics. The query runs on the dex\_trades table available in the Top Ledger platform.

```sql
select block_date, swaps, SUM(swaps) over(order by block_date) as cumulative_swaps
        , swap_transactions, SUM(swap_transactions) over(order by block_date) as cumulative_swap_transactions
        , traders, SUM(new_traders) over(order by block_date) as cumulative_traders
from
(
select block_date, count(tx_id) as swaps, count(distinct tx_id) as swap_transactions, count(distinct signer) as traders
        , count(distinct case when rn1 = 1 then signer end) as new_traders
from
(
select date(partition_0) as block_date, tx_id, d.signer
        , row_number() over(partition by d.signer order by date(partition_0)) as rn1
from tl_solana.dex_trades d 
where date(partition_0) >= date'2023-01-01'
) A 
group by 1
) A 
order by 1 desc
```

Since the dex\_trades table contains all the swap transactions that have happened in the DEX ecosystem, we just need to count the number of transactions on a daily basis. Then, in the second part of the query, we need to aggregate the daily transactions over the entire period to get the cumulative number of transactions since 2023.

## Swap Volume

Now, let's consider the example of swap volume, i.e., how we are going to compute it. The charts below show the daily swap volume for various DEX programs and the cumulative swap volume.

The SQL code below begins by assigning various program addresses to their respective names and selecting other fields such as block\_date, base\_amount, quote\_amount, base\_mint, quote\_mint, etc. It then calculate the swap amounts on a daily basis, grouped by the program through which the swap happened.

```sql
with cte_raw as 
(
select date_trunc('day', block_time) as block_date
          , tx_id
          , case when outer_program = 'whirLbMiicVdio4qvUfM5KAg6Ct8VwpYzGff3uctyCc' then 'Orca Liquidity Pools'
                 when inner_program = 'whirLbMiicVdio4qvUfM5KAg6Ct8VwpYzGff3uctyCc' then 'Orca Liquidity Pools'

Then, the daily swap amount in multiple tokens needs to be converted to USD, which is accomplished using the price table (tl\_solana.prices). Once that is done, we need to sum the amounts in USD over the specified period to calculate the cumulative swap amount in USD.

## Active Wallets

Active wallets are a crucial metric for any dApp in Web3. More wallets imply higher usage of the dApp by users, which also means more revenue opportunities for the dApp in terms of fees and other charges, making any dApp more viable and profitable.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 1.46.32 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Active wallets across DEXs since Jan 2023</p></figcaption></figure>

Let's go through the SQL code to learn how to calculate active wallets for the DEX ecosystem.

```sql
select block_date, swaps, SUM(swaps) over(order by block_date) as cumulative_swaps
        , swap_transactions, SUM(swap_transactions) over(order by block_date) as cumulative_swap_transactions
        , traders, SUM(new_traders) over(order by block_date) as cumulative_traders
from
(
select block_date, count(tx_id) as swaps, count(distinct tx_id) as swap_transactions, count(distinct signer) as traders
        , count(distinct case when rn1 = 1 then signer end) as new_traders
from
(
select date(partition_0) as block_date, tx_id, d.signer
        , row_number() over(partition by d.signer order by date(partition_0)) as rn1
from tl_solana.dex_trades d 
where date(partition_0) >= date'2023-01-01'
) A 
group by 1
) A 
order by 1 desc
```

To count active wallets over time, we can use the [Rank](https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/window.html) function to count a wallet only once for the entire period, regardless of the number of swaps performed using the same wallet. Thereafter, we need to sum all the unique wallets that have ever performed a trade. And that's it; we have the total number of active wallets.
