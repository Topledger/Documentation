When wallets are most active in trading (time of day, day of the week)?

Why have wallets been deactivated, how long they remain inactive, and whether they switch to other platforms? Look into wallets that become active again, especially their first activity after coming back.

How can we categorize wallets by their willingness to take risks, shown by the kinds of loans they choose, such as those with more collateral versus less, or short-term compared to long-term?

## Products

### 1. SQL Based Analytics Platform

Our backend pulls raw data from Solana daily, labels, indexes it into tables, and maintains a historical archive for easy querying, empowering you to create in-depth metrics effortlessly.

We decode the Solana program data and segregate it program wise so that you focus on generating deeper insights. We do it by going into each programâ€™s rust codebase and mapping every function and its arguments.

Finally create meaningful graphs, powerful dashboards and present it as you like.

#### Powerful Dashboards

A picture is worth a thousand words & a dashboard is worth a million data points. Great stories are the perfect blend of data, visuals and content. This is where dashboards come into play. Data visualizations you create by writing queries, can be placed together to connect the dots and build a meaningful story to present in front of stakeholders, customers, investors, etc.

As an example, in the dashboard below, the first chart depicts the total swap volume since Jan 2023 for DEX ecosystem on Solana. Second one is giving a different perspective by showing daily swap volume for all DEXs while the third one is showing cumulative trends of the volume over the same time period. The fourth and fifth chart depicts the monthly trends and share of respective DEX platform in the total swap volume.  Overall the audience is getting a bird eye view of the DEX ecosystem on the Solana blockchain.
